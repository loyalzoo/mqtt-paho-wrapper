# mqtt-paho-wrapper
A wrapper for the javascript paho MQTT library to ensure the connection to the broker is stable

This library was created as we were having trouble with MQTT Paho not receiving messages when it was supposedly subscribed

This wrapper also contains functions which we hope may be useful such as clientID generation
